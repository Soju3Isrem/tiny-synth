# Overview

Tiny-synth is a an audio "synth" module written in verilog, for synthesis on an FPGA device.  It's called tiny-synth because it's reasonably small and simple - at least it started out that way - but also because it's been developed on a TinyFPGA BX board, which is genuinely quite tiny!

The synth itself is loosely (okay, maybe not so loosely) based on the legendary MOS 6581 (SID) chip that provided audio to the Commodore 64.  It was something I thought I'd try as an introductory project for a [TinyFPGA](http://tinyfpga.com) [BX](https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html) board that I'd purchased.

The building blocks of the synth are "voices"; each voice is made up of:

- a tone generator (capable of generating saw, triangle, square/pulse and noise waveforms).
- an ADSR envelope generator.
- an amplitude modulator that modulates the volume of the tone with the envelope generator's output.

"Analog" output is handled by a pulse-density modulator.  This means that you'll need at least a simple low-pass RC filter on the output pin(s) in order to use it.

The below circuit works well enough for me, but YMMV.

```      
       e.g. 330 ohm      eg. 0.1uF
  DOUT   ---./\/\/\.---o------| |-------> "Analog" output
                       |
                      ---
                      --- eg. 0.1uF
                       |
                       |
                      --- GND
                       -                 
```

The module has been synthesized and bench-tested on a TinyFPGA BX board.

If you've got any problems or questions, please raise an issue against the project.

If you'd like to contribute to the project, pull requests are welcomed!  I'd especially love to see additional waveforms and something like a state-variable filter that can be wired into the audio path!  

If you use tiny-synth somewhere, or find this in any way useful please let us know!

## Basic usage : TL;DR

In your top-level module you will need to instantiate a ```voice``` module, and wire it up to a ```pdm_dac``` module.  Note the parameters below are constants, but you'll probably
want to connect these to a mechanism for controlling them.

```verilog

    reg [11:0] voice_data;

    // instantiate a synthesizer voice
    voice voice(
      .clk(ONE_MHZ_CLK),
      .tone_freq(16'd16721),      /* (16777216/16721) * 1000000Hz = 1kHz tone */
      .waveform_enable(4'b0001),  /* triangle tone generator */
      .pulse_width(12'd0),        /* pulse width only used for pulse waveform */
      .rst(1'b0),                 /* force ReSeT pin low */
      .ringmod_enable(1'b0),      /* disable ringmod */
      .ringmod_source(1'b0),      /* (source connection for ringmod; forced to zero) */
      .gate(SLOW_CLK),            /* gate on triggers attack; gate off triggers decay */
      .attack(4'b0001),           /* attack rate */
      .decay(4'b0001),            /* decay rate */
      .sustain(4'b1000),          /* sustain level */
      .rel(4'b0010)               /* release rate */
      .dout(voice_data),          /* route output to voice_data register */
    );

    // instantiate a DAC to take voice output and route it to an external pin with PDM modulation
    pdm_dac #(.DATA_BITS(12)) ch1_dac(
      .din(voice_data),
      .clk(CLK),
      .dout(PIN_1)
    );
```

# Modules
## voice

Each voice has a 24-bit phase-accumulator which is used to generate the Output
waveforms.

It also has an ADSR envelope generator.

The envelope generator uses a linear attack, and an exponential fall-off function for the
decay and release cycles.

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| `clk:1` | reference clock for the tone generator |
| `tone_freq:16` | Value to add to the phase-accumulator every `clk` cycle.  When the accumulator overflows, the next output cycle starts. <br><br>`Fout (Hz)` = (`tone_freq` x `clk`) / 16777216 <br><br>`tone_freq` = (`Fout (Hz)` x 16777216) / `clk` |
| `waveform_enable:4` | `0001` = triangle /\/\/\<br>`0010` = saw /&#124;/&#124;/&#124;<br>`0100` = pulse  _-_-_-_<br>`1000` = LFSR noise (random).  <br><br>If multiple waveforms are selected, the outputs are logically ANDed together. |
| `pulse_width:12` | when pulse waveform is selected, if accumulator < `pulse_width`, output is high; else low |
| `rst:1` | reset; when high, the accumulator is reset; as is the ADSR envelope generator. |
| `ringmod_enable:1` | enable the ring modulator (only has any effect when the triangle wave is selected) |
| `ringmod_source:1` | source of modulation; should be the MSB from another voice's accumulator; this triggers the inversion of this voice's triangle waveform (as opposed to using it's own MSB). |
| `gate` | A rising gate will trigger the ADSR cycle to begin, according to the timings in the `attack`/`decay`/`sustain`/`release` parameters. A falling gate will trigger the release cycle. |
| `attack:4` | How long it takes the envelope generator attack cycle to go from zero volume to full-scale. <br><br>`0000` = 2ms<br>`0001` = 8ms<br>`0010` = 16ms<br>`0011` = 24ms<br>`0100` = 38ms<br>`0101` = 56ms<br>`0110` = 68ms<br>`0111` = 80ms<br>`1000` = 100ms<br>`1001` = 250ms<br>`1010` = 500ms<br>`1011` = 800ms<br>`1100` = 1 second<br>`1101` = 3 seconds<br>`1110` = 5 seconds<br>`1111` = 8 seconds|
| `decay:4` | How long it takes the envelope generator to decay from full-scale after attack to the sustain level. <br><br>`0000` = 6ms<br>`0001` = 24ms<br>`0010` = 48ms<br>`0011` = 72ms<br>`0100` = 114ms<br>`0101` = 168ms<br>`0110` = 204ms<br>`0111` = 240ms<br>`1000` = 300ms<br>`1001` = 750ms<br>`1010` = 1.5 seconds<br>`1011` = 2.4 seconds<br>`1100` = 3 seconds<br>`1101` = 9 seconds<br>`1110` = 15 seconds<br>`1111` = 24 seconds|
| `sustain:4` | The level that the note will be sustained at while the 'gate' is still enabled. Values range from zero (off; ie. note will decay to zero without a sustain phase) to 15 (max). |
| `rel:4` | How long it takes the envelope generator to fall from the sustain level to zero once the gate has been switched off. <br><br>`0000` = 6ms<br>`0001` = 24ms<br>`0010` = 48ms<br>`0011` = 72ms<br>`0100` = 114ms<br>`0101` = 168ms<br>`0110` = 204ms<br>`0111` = 240ms<br>`1000` = 300ms<br>`1001` = 750ms<br>`1010` = 1.5 seconds<br>`1011` = 2.4 seconds<br>`1100` = 3 seconds<br>`1101` = 9 seconds<br>`1110` = 15 seconds<br>`1111` = 24 seconds |
| `dout:12` | digital sample output; a new sample is generated every CLK cycle. |

## pdm_dac

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| `din:12` | Input data samples |
| `clk:1` | High speed clock for output |
| `dout:1` | Pulse-density modulated output |
